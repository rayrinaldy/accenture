#Scope/Requirement guidance:
- Implement a functional prototype
- Implement Social Login (i.e. Facebook) or a way to identify unique users
- Consider using cloud – AWS, GCP, Azure. If not, an app that can run on localhost is still acceptable
- Consider using building blocks you can find from other APIs – http://www.programmableweb.com/ , Google Map API etc.


1. Hotels should look to re-hauling their loyalty programme to offer better financial benefits and highly personalised services.
2. People dislike uncertainty that is inherent in Airbnb, are used to personal attention and require their ‘hygiene’ services like pools, spas, room service, etc. Building more personalised experiences to pamper (and even pander) to this group will be the need of the hour.
3. Building an ecosystem of partners
4. Emphasize Your Unique Amenities
5. Adjust the Marketing Message
6. Optimize the Booking Process


A coordinated attack on all fronts- price, positioning and policy will be essential.
